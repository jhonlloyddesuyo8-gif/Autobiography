During lunch, while the others talked about a party, Jordan stayed quiet, staring at the math worksheet in his hands. Ms. Daniels had pulled him aside last week: “You’ve got potential, but you’ve gotta focus.”

It stuck with him.

Later that day, he skipped basketball practice to meet with her after school. It wasn’t cool, but it felt right.

On the walk home, earbuds in, hoodie up, Jordan felt something he hadn’t in a while — proud.

High school wasn’t just about popularity or hype. It was about choices. Growth.

And every day, Jordan was learning how to move smarter.
